	Exciting to announce, there is a new section on the Website!! This kinda happend unexpectedly, was
	going to build a site for my stock images (actually still might) and decided 
	that the logos and such, really a lot of it 
	would be great here. We have so many Content Creators, Bloggers, Social Media Inluencers
	and really all around just creative people
	stopping through, that can always use some good images for your work.
</p>

    So now, if your trying to find some unique digital art, that isn't everywhere on the average
	stock image sites, you found a new gold mine of illustrations. Finally that this option is here,
	I'm going to dedicate more time to building illustrations and logos again, totally jazzed and inspired
	by this.
</p>
		
<p>
    Anybody that has ever sold stock photos or illustrations, knows that the companies
	pay you next to nothing for your work ha. It's almost ridiculous how little ya actually
	make on there (.25 Cents) So in a way it's very discouraging, and a little insulting as an artist..
	I say Artist because our graphics are art! They do take time, lots of creativity, 
	along with skills in tons of different ways. So we take pride in our work as Artists and Designers.

<p>
	With some of that said, now there's a shopping cart option here with the downloads button! 
	Awesome addition to the site, with this purchase of the royalty free
	illustrations, you can do what you please with them (as long as it's not racist)
	And us as the artist is being fairly compensated, so this works out a lot better.
</p>
		
<p>
	As we charge a more premium price, it will help support the artist, and also to ensure
	that quality is kept, because no one needs to rush now, you can charge what each illustration or image is worth. When a graphic designer is
	getting paid .25 cents the quality level and enthusiasm is obviously dropped, because no one is being
	compensated fairly. If people were to hire a 
	designer to make a logo or an image, it would cost a pretty penny, because the time and skill is valuable.

	While writing this, (might go off subject here ha) the other thoughts that are coming to mind.
	Who knows who reads this, possibly you might gain some inspiration from this, maybe you
	are person who is trying to get into the photography, or graphic design, video, maybe possibly
	drone work, even audio, or other fine trades
	that require similar selling techniques.. My suggestion, and mind you this is just a suggestion,
	you to could have a site that sells your art and designs, rather then submit to the large 
	population of artist that use stock sites. If you put even half as much effort as you have to do
	with a traditional stock site, you'll most likely be way more succesful and stoked about
	the enitre experience. And in the long run you'll have built something more solid and possible
	to live off of.. Yes it takes a while to build up, but with stock sites that stuff takes a
	long time to build up as well. Experienced people recommend that you have thousands of
	illustrations and images on there to make a little bit of money. Anyways this blog just turned into
	lets encourage artist to start their own gig;)  Saying this because I want you
	to have good experiences in the field.
<!--	Feeling like I waisted so much time on the stock sites, yes I gained a little experience on how they work and the process, jazz like that.--->

	Ok back on track here,
	at the moment when you download the illustrations here they're all High Res,
	the average size is 1920x1920 px 300 resolution. Well all of them are at least 1920 px wide,
	and some heights vary depending on illustration.
	My thought process was, give the quality larger size illustrations, let you the user
	customize it down to the appropriate size of your project. In the future there will be some
	options for smaller sizes. In the back of my head the reason I want to add more sizes, is some people
	may not have the ability to resize projects, or situation may not allow them to at the moment.
	These are just the thoughts, so we can be on the same page or same understanding.
</p>
		
<p>
	In reality I'm a new developer, and as learning happens, which is luckily everyday ha. Situations will
	improve and be more efficient. As building and programming, constantly am thinking oh should
	do it this way or that way,
	but it will be a process that always evolves. So, with that info, if there ever is a problem with a design,
	 illustration, or function, please let me know and I will fix what ever the situation maybe.
	Definitely I try to
	tripple check everything, but mistakes slip through, hope that wasn't to much info ha, it's good to be
	transparent with business in my eyes tho.
