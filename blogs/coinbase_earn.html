	<h1>Coinbase Earn & Learn</h1>	
		
<p>Lets dive in and start talking about a place to begin and learn and you can Earn.
	
	<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5463e532baa1e4d022000001" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>,
	it's one of the best places to start off. How sweet is that, that they're
	even giving away Free Crypto in their Earn and Learn program "at least at the time of writing this
	they're giving away free crypto on their site to learn"..

	No strings attached, they're trying to
	teach more people about cryptocurrencies, helping educate the public while 
	spreading some coins around as well,
	so people can get their toe wet so to speak before diving fully in..
</p>
					
<p>
	Definitely a smart move on coinbases part, I tried it and definitely
	recieved money in crypto for each different video I watched and answered a few questions on..
	Videos were literally between  1 - 3 minutes for $2.. I did do a few that were a bit longer but I got paid
	between $10-$14 for them if I can remember correctly..
	like was saying each video they give ya a few bucks, not
	like some programs ya gotta watch 20 videos to earn $1, this ya watch a 1-2 minute video,
	and then they give ya a few bucks to your coinbase wallet, very simple, next video another $2..

	It worked out
	good in my case because I'm already interested in crypto and was interested to learn
	about the subjects or coins they were teaching about.. Everyone I meet who is first getting into
	the crypto market I send them there first.. Because it gives ya a little education,
	and some activity with your wallet. Which gives the new user some adjusting to how
	crypto wallets function and operate, also seeing what the site looks like,
	just getting an over all feel for
	everything, getting some free crypto along with all that makes it even better..
</p>

	A different way to look at it as well is, eventually you'll have a few coins or tokens 
	that you've earned and that they've given ya through airdrops,
	and over the years, it will be interesting to see what they turn into.. yes by value and also
	curious to see how each of those companies blossom, they could be the next Amazon,
	or Apple of the crypto world.. In my eyes, this is just my opinion, we are so new in the crypto world,
	just around ten years of existence, and really just beginning to become in mainstream media
	with a good reputation for adoption.. Aything can happen in this game, so ya that
	was maybe off the subject, but it came to my mind..
</p>

<p>
	Hope that info helped and you can now begin to be on your way to earning Crypto with Coinbase..
