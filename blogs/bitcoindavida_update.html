	<h1>Bitcoin Davida Update</h1>		
	 <p>Todays Blog is kinda just a recap or a summary of what's been new with the
	Bitcoin Davida site.. Over the last few years so much has happend, 
	 being with the crypto space, technology, science, there's just so many great
	instances!! So with the Davida site here, originally I built it and still
	feeling this way, cause I wanted to help out new people entering the crypto space.
	Everyday I mention crypto or and Bitcoin to someone!! I have a
	feeling tho that all of us are that weird friend
	that talks about crypto a lot ha. Then from that person it leads to a never ending
	list of questions, concerns, and all sorts of suggestions. So I had noticed
	that it tended to have the same kinda of info that I would be explaining to
	each individual.. not to be like this and that about it, but every beginner
	needs to know where to buy bitcoin, what an altcoin is, where and what a
	hardware wallet is.. I figured why not make a website, write this info down,
	and send them there first. then if they have questions they can either come
	here, see if there is the answers they are looking for, or google more direct
	questions, watch a youtube video, or even ask me if we bump into each other again..
	</p>
			
<p>Here's a little bit of the journey! So when I first started the site, which was back in 2016,
	had just used a website builder, from godaddy. Something simple and easy, click and drag.
	but, started to see some limitations, being ya can't just put the charts
	where ever ya want, or certain restrictions sometimes, just seen that I wanted to be
	able to do more.. Eventually decided that was wanting to rebuild the site
	or have it built up more, into something better with a variety of functions.. Also forgot
	to mention the mobile view was very bad.. pretty much nonexistent..
	And in this day and age if your website isn't mobile friendly, forget about it,
	your fighting yourself, ya need to be mobile friendly and now also smart watch
	accesible.. These are the things that I began to notice.. 
</p>
			
<p>Long story shorter, paid a company to help build a site, and then
	that never happened lost that money with them.
	was disappointed and getting ready to hit the road, had hoped to promote the site
	along the way. Sooo, had godaddy set me up with a wordpress site and they built 
	something up, copying the old site I had. Which was sorta ok, 
	but really wanted something Awesome and super functional.
	The reason I paid to have them do it,
	was, as was saying earlier had hoped for a professinal looking site.
	Wanted the second try on the Davida site to be done right this time, cause I did
	the original, it was descent, but needed to step it's game up... Eventually, got
	the site from them, but the mobile view again was nonexistent, 
	or atleast on my iphone5. Later I did tutorial after tutorial watching videos
	on how to use wordpress and different plugins, so I could dial it in an put charts
	and info where had liked.. Was feeling like a real
	web dev at that time in life lol, oh how I had so much to 
	learn and didn't even know it yet...
</p>
			
<p> Yet again, had come to a point where I seen limitations in the
	worpress setup, and decided needed to learn more. Through tons more tutorials,
	began to discover html, css, javascript, python, solidity all these awesome
	programming languages started to appear before my eyes. A new world was
	opening up. So that's where the transition evolved again, was living in my truck,
	traveling around, "well really the market was down so low"
    and figured would go on a sabatical or somethin. 
</p>
			
<p>
	While learning to program and write some code, one of the projects had given
	myself, was dig into the Davida site (probably in the future changing the name) rebuild it,  
	see what can make it into, have fun with it!
	Because while your learning you need something to work on anyways,
	it's not like an official class, I just watch as many tutorials as possible
	and practice with the videos at the same time, or I have books that I write my notes
	down in and refer back to em through out, as needed.. It actually turned into a
	big life change for me, wound up dedicating a ton of time to the learning process.
	I have a entire new respect for developers and programmers since the journey
	began. 
</p>
			
<p>One of the things I said to myself while living out of the truck,
	and studying up on the crypto market was, if you like Bitcoin so much,
	get involved. Don't just wait for your coin to go up, and reep the benifits of
	someones elses project. Build something, help them if ya can, at least 
	start learning and figure out where ya fit in with it.. Much of the info 
	out there is opensource these days, it's a great opportunity to learn, 
	and also add something to bunches of other peoples cool projects..
</p>	
				
<p>	
	I guess to wrap this up some, ya that was a brief history or maybe it was a ramble session.
	But if people who haven't met me before are like whats going on here with this page ha, that
	hopefully cleared things up for ya. Because more people are starting to use the charts pages here
	and find links to navigate to other resources. Again, it's really for beginners, to help guide them to
	the right spots, or learn some of the basics to get them started, in a friendly, chill "but blunt" way..
