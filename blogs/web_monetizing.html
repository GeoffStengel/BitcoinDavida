	<h1>Web Monetizing</h1>	
<p>In this day an age of the Wild West Of The
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank">Internet</a>, the big Thang is, everyone is
	competing over Y-O-U-R Data!! They Want Your Info Bad, either it being your email address, what you shop for,
	where you surf on the internet, what articles you click on while browsing social media, and who you follow on 
	either Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook as a few examples.. Advertisers can hone in on what you fancy the most 
	or totally dislike.. In certain ways, it's interesting to see more focused ads on your desires, in other
	ways.. it's just plain creepy. </p>
			
<p> So on that note tho, we are all trying to block the ads as well ha, and I say "we" cause I think they can be
	distracting, and a little over bearing at times.. + plus all the reasons I named above..
			
</p>		

<p>But on the other hand, as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog" target="_blank">blogger</a> or
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation#Content_creators" target="_blank">content
	creator</a>,
	we look for different avenues to make a little money on the side.. So then, we have to go back to the idea of 
	ads and such.. Of course, we need to make a little dough? why would we want to spend that
	time away for nothing, and it's not just the thing about free, it's it takes time to research or build the
	sites, it's actual work to obtain the info, or build up others sites or social newtworks for nothing in
	return? These are the questions that come up..
	
	Maybe you've tried
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_monetization" target="_blank">Web Monetizing</a> your Youtube
	
	chanel, or getting paid by the click from advertisers.. Either way there are a ton of companies, willing to
	pay you for a little bit of sharing some info and space on your website, blog, or
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog" target="_blank">vlog</a>.	
</p>
		
<p> The Next question is, who do you choose and how? Do you pick a company like Youtube, Google, or One of the
	many new browser companies trying to enter the game? Have played around with 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRZ3AJn1khc" target="_blank">Youtube</a>, and am newish to a few 
	companies one being <a href="https://coil.com" target="blank">Coil</a>, and the other is
	<a href="https://brave.com/bit924" target="_blank">Brave Browser</a>.. <!--Every day glad to be learning something new about the evolving business.---> </p> 
			
	<p>Ok, the differences and the cool
	unique features of all these.. First, if you monetize with someone like Youtube, what you're getting is,
	money for each time someone watches your video, in exchange they are loading commercials in your video,
	either one to a few videos depending on how much your trying to get paid for your content.. Pro's is you get
	paid per video, cons is some viewers don't like watching annoying commercials, and monetizing with youtube
	it only works on youtube, not your blog or websites you create "videos only".. so that's where the debate or
	possibly the new monetizing systems developed from.. People didn't like seeing the popup ads, or clickbait
	sites, the commercials were ruining the user experience, they wanted to monetize other creations besides
	videos as well.. So now some of the new companies, just monitor your users in the background, and check and
	gather the analytics of users traffic, for a small fee, they took away the ads..</p> 
			
<p> This next one is called
	<a href="https://coil.com" target="_blank">Coil</a>. They're a company out of San Fransico, that recently
	opened up (2018 - 2019), or branched off of somewhat from Ripple.. I had super high expectations for this one cause I'm a
	hodler of xrp and I dig Ripples technology, but it kinda reminded me of a multi use utility tool, "those never work out good in my
	eyes"... Some might say, well what about a
	<a href="https://www.leatherman.com/multi-tools" target="_blank">Leatherman</a>, or a
	<a href="https://www.swissarmy.com/us/en/Swiss-Army-Knives/cms/swissarmyknives-main" target="_blank">Swiss Army Knife</a>, those are good multi use
	utility tools? My response would be, Yes I agree those are good products, but go work on a contruction site
	with only one of those you'll be cryin for a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill" target="_blank">drill</a> by 10 am ha.. Same with Coil, they
	need to just stick to one idea, and go with that, are they trying
	to be a social network site, a web monetization company, an advertising firm, or a browser? The browser
	does nothing all that special, or at least from a customers point of view, and you have to enable it to view 
	their site and surfing the web, that's how other content creators get paid? so at least make it that the
	browser has other really cool features or some other reason for us to want to use it, or feel that we need
	it.. cause at the moment the features, all of them are subpar.. but for real, if you go to their site
	and became a member or creator, it's hard to even search for anything or other users..
	Yes I have definitly tried emailing their support team a few times, a very poor responding company
	in the game as well ha.. For real, if you aren't a big youtube or twitter star, they will not respond,
	or at least in a timely fashion.. as of this blog I'm still waiting on a response 6 days later lol..
	next question people ask is, how much have I earned with them, having my different sites and my chanel
	monetized with? in around 6 months, I have earned 0 XRP "Updated 2 XRP".. I was part of their
	beta program, so i've had early access.. Also My opinion comes from what I've seen
	with the mulitple people that I've helped sign up, and help create accounts for.
	They as well have not earned either from the Coil site "and their content is good"....
	I do gotta say tho, I feel there is some potential for the right person, or even business,
	if done right, you could make some money.. maybe my experiences and people I know were fluke chances..
	cause online people say it's working for them.. it's good to go over all sides of the opinion,
	then make your own judgments.. anyways.. 
</p>
			

<p>Next up is <a href="https://brave.com/bit924" target="_blank">Brave</a>, I can't say enough good things about
	this company.. First of all if you just go try their browser you'll fall in love, obviously it's super
	functional!! It blocks the ads, stops trackers, the overall experience is a total delight.. You can surf the
	Web on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29" target="_blank">Tor Browser</a>
	as well that they offer for total privacy.. Reminds me of when I first started using the internet and there
	wasn't one ad or fricken popup, ya just surfed the web, could look at info, and get your work done.. Have to
	point out one very special thing, when picking a company, sometimes think of it as picking a sports team, you 
	look at the players, the people involved in the team, and ya see what's up with that first.. When i started
	to look into Brave, and the team at BAT "Basic Attention Token".. I noticed one cool thing right off the bat
	"no pun intended lol" that one of their key players is the inventor of
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>.. I sh*t you not, that was
	a big eye opener when researching teams and companies.
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" target="_blank">Brendan Eich</a> has been in this game
	for a very long time and obviously makes great products.. JavaScript is used to build most of the websites we
	look at today, so it makes sense this would be another one of his projects and products.. Ok, enough jockin
	Brendan Eich lol.. Back to their web Monetizing, right from the get go I earned BAT Token, which was a good
	sign.. BAT is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency" target="_blank">cryptocurrency</a> so
	I can exchange the BAT Tokens for usd if I like through
	<a href="https://uphold.com" target="_blank">Uphold</a> exchange.. But you get paid if people tip,
	sometimes they do Grants, or if you're on their regularly viewed sites list tips come your way. There are a
	few ways I've noticed that BAT somehow gets into my wallet.. You can Monetize your Youtube, Websites, Twitch
	account, Twitter, and they seem to be adding more.. Again, many avenues to get paid through with them. Which
	obviously I liked ha.</p> 
			
<p> But with social networking being such a big craze, we should get a few bucks here and there for building up
	those sites.. Cause in reality, every time you post something, liking someones comments, share a page, you
	are Building that companies site up and making new links for them.. They should be giving you stuff more
	often really, cause you earned it.. That is another reason I see web monetization becoming an even bigger
	market in the future, people are starting to wake up and realize that their content is worth something.. So I
	guess out of this blog, you can tell that Brave is number one choice for web monetizing, but I'm not stubborn
	over earning money, so a little secret is, I use all these things to make a buck, just incase and see which
	ones pan out in the long run..
