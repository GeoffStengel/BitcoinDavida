	It is almost like I have to try out every exchange ha! But In the last few years, more and more ways to buy,
	sell, or trade crypto are popping up. With this many options opening, it’s really starting
	to raise the bar for new businesses jumping in the crypto world, to keep, better, standards.
</p>
<p>		  
	One of the other reason I really like that we are having more options, for buying and selling crypto is.
	Makes it easier for us to be able use our banks as an option, to be able to use credit or debit cards to fund
	an account. Also it is more convenient to sell crypto and actually get money back to us, because before it was 
	kinda a pain to sell crypto quickly and receive money to our banks. Either to pay bills and such, or even
	just be able to spend, mind as well be able to use it because, alot of people are into this for investment
	purposes. I know having banks involved defeats some of the purposes of why some people even got involved in
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency" target="_blank">Crypto</a> and
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">Blockchain Technology,</a>
	is for the anonymity or privacy aspect, and kinda not for transactions to
	be as traceable. Really tho the more I learn, it's incredibly easier to trace transactions, and trace money
	with blockchain technology, guess that depends on which blockchain or which coin.
	But that conversation will be for another blog.</p>

 <p>So here we are going to talk about Uphold exchange, there are many different uses for this particular site in
	 the crypto world. From transferring money around, either to a business or a friend, also they make it
	 easy between members at the click of a button it will be there. You can either visit them on desktop,
	 mobile version or app. I just started using it pretty recently June of 2018, so far it’s been
	 a great experience! For
	 sign up and approval, it just took about 15-20 min, to fund the account was another few minutes before
	 actually purchasing crypto. So we’ll say about 25 minutes total.</p>

<p> The First step after arriving at Uphold's website or app,
	You have to send a picture of your ID, front and back, which is pretty standard procedure for most exchanges.
	<a href="info_on_crypto.html" target="_blank">
	(you can read more about that in a previous blog I wrote called Info On Crypto.)</a>
	Then to begin funding your account, either transfer crypto from a private wallet to the exchange 
	to one of your “cards”. Which your cards are basically your wallet for each coin or token on that exchange,
	but they look like a credit card by appearance, personally I like that design. Also you can do your funding
	by a bank transfer or credit/debit card. I did notice when I funded my usd card by credit card, it charged
	my bank as a cash advance, my bank said it was how the company had it setup for some reason, so if you can,
	use your debit card for lower fees from your bank.
</p>
<p>		  
	Ok so you fund it by one of those options, for example
	purposes will say you used a debit card. The transaction will go to your usd card that is on Uphold, then
	from that you would pick a coin or token that you would like to purchase and for example purposes again we’ll
	say your buying XRP. When you first sign up to the site they start you off with around 4-5 cards that are
	displayed on your dash board. To load up on XRP, you would have to go down the list and click add a new card,
	it will give you options of all the cards that are available and you would pick the one you desire. So we
	picked xrp for example, then it will ask you to transfer from another card to that one to make the purchase.
	At that time it tells you the price that the coin or token is at. Hit the button, Whalla transaction finished. 
</p>
<p>		  
	Side note here, One of the only things
	that I think they need to really update on the site is charts, there are none available on there. I
	really like to look at the charts and see the price in front of me before purchasing really.
	A few little things like that, but it has come in handy. 
</p>
<p>			  
	This is a update from the year 2019, at the moment
	Uphold exchange is also used and needed for Brave Browser, so users can get paid in BAT earnings. Uphold is
	basically your wallet that can store your tokens at the moment,
	in the future you will be able to have other options like Trezor or Ledger,
	but at the moment, Uphold is the main wallet supporting it.
	<a href="brave_review.html" target="_blank">More info here at my blog called Brave Browser Review</a>,
	also some more info on Brave Browser in another blog I did called 
	<a href="web_monetizing.html" target="_blank">Web Monetizing.</a>
	Hopefully you found this blog helpful and it shows ya how easy it is to get started with Uphold.
