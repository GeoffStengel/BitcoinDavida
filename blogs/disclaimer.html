	<div class="disclaimerish">
<p>		
	Before I forget, this is kinda of a broad or general disclaimer "disclamerish".. throughout the website
	some of the links have an affiliate link with "if lucky making a few dollars here and there",
	only have them on products that I use or used myself, and think for real
	that they're a good product, or at least up to standards based on todays technology and ability..
	also the affiliate link is in there as well, because we
	were probably already talking about the product and was already recommending or suggesting,
	so mind as well make a few bucks if possible.. that's how the site can keep going,
	just like to lay my cards on the table. yup there was my disclamerish, oh also
	I'm not a professional, stuff here is opinions, and you should always do your own research, 
	the other most common saying only bet what you can afford to lose.. hopefully that covers that on the legal jargen..
</p>
			
<p>
	also from time to time, i come back and update some of the content, always finding
	little mistakes or typos, trying to keep everything as accurate as possible. 
	Thank you hope the site is helpful enjoy!
