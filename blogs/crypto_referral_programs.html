<p> There are a lot of different avenues for you to earn Free Bitcoin, and other Altcoins!! You can do
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_marketing" target="_blank">Referral</a>
	or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing" target="_blank">Affiliate</a>
	Programs, which some of these even have links for. But mind as well,
	if you are using some of the apps, exchanges or different products and you like it.
	Give it a go, share your links with friends, earn some extra coins, tokens,
	credits or stocks even!! Some people are able to make a small living off this if you share 
	your referral links with enough people, or have a strong following on Social Media outlets.
	
</p>
		
 <p>Also it doesn't have to be just sharing between friends either. If you're good at marketing,
	or feeling like an 
	 <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur" target="_blank">entrepreneur</a>,
	 here is your chance to let those skills shine. You can basically
	start a business with not much over head and promote the companies, earning
	 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_%28remuneration%29" target="_blank">commission</a>.
	 It's a great opportunity for the right person to work from home and make a living.
</p>

<p>
	If you're doing it more as a business, then you would want to check and see if they have an Affiliate Program, not just Referrals. With the Affiliate program and links, you can earn a little better
	commission as far as I've seen. Also
	with the Affiliate programs the company usually has some images, banners, little write ups that you can
	use to help advertise the products. They also do have some rules from time to time so check the info
	each one has, to make sure you stay in guidelines. 
</p>		

<p> (Recently added this) I've actually come back from the future to update some of the info in these blogs.
	Now that I've come back to update this, wanted to say I'm only doing recommendations
	for products, exchanges, or other companies that I use or have used. If I hadn't used the product yet,
	then it has probably been removed from the blog, and list if you dont see certain items
	on here anymore.
	I will be trying more products, then will add them accordingly if they're good, not just because
	they have referral links.</p>
				
<p>
<!--	Hi I've actually come back from the future to update some of the info in these blogs.-->
	Also some feedback
	after trying these programs for the last few years. When I had originally wrote the blog it was back in 2017
    or something. So now that it's ending 2019, (Wow time has flown) figured lets add to
	the list and update some info. And give some more real time feedback.
</p>				

<p>
	My goal here is to have a list of reputable companies for you to promote and feel good about, 
	not to just have some
	clickbait site or something. So all of the ones I recommend, are tried and true good companies to
	work with. Because sometimes finding a trustworthy company can be the hardest part about promoting.
	When you can find a company or product that has a great team, it makes the sales almost effortless.
	And that's how I really like it, you dont want to be begging people to try something, you want them
	to say why didn't you tell me about this sooner!!

<p>A great place to start in the crypto world is with Coinbase, for people needing to use credit cards or bank
	transfers to buy crypto, this site can get you going in just a few clicks. 
	The selection of crypto is pretty basic, but all
	good picks, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. And since updating this blog they now
	have added XRP, Golem, 0x, EOS, and USDC. If you're in the U.S then this is one of the
	fastest and easiest ways to buy crypto online.
</p>	
	<p>For the referral program, they reward each party with
	$10 in crypto, after the new party signs up and spends $100. They also after signing up, have a Affiliate
	Program that has a little better rewards from time to time they sweet'n the deals with. To be an
	affiliate you do need to be accepted, and there's a waiting period of some sort that can vary in time
	up to a few weeks. But I like Coinbase so thinking the wait is worth it. I also have
	a few blogs written about the exchange called <a href="coinbase_earn.html" target="_blank">Coinbase Earn</a>
	and <a href="coinbase_guide.html" target="_blank">Coinbase Guide</a> if you would like a more in debth
	review.</p>

<p>This exchange is awesome, for the mobile app or desktop version, the design and the lay out are perfect for my
   liking. For function I would also give it two thumbs up. It has a good size selection of coins and tokens 
   available for trade. So this is a definite company that I feel good referring for either trading, or for you
   referring this site to others.</p>
<p>Binance update for US Citizens. If you're from the States, they have a new site for Binance that is coming
   out called Binance.us, because of the recent regualtions, they're changing some of the ways Americans can
   trade or purchase crypto. So as soon as I know more, will update this blog again, but until then
   keep going as planned.</p>

<p>A Hardware Wallet is a must have for keeping your crypto safe!! There are two companies that are the most
	recommended, if your getting into crypto and want to 
	<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp" target="_blank">hodl</a>
	your investments safe, Ledger Nano S or Trezor.
	Both are an excellent choice. The reason I have both types is because you can hodl different coins or tokens
	on both wallets. Here's a links to another of my blogs that talks about Hardware
	Wallets and these two brands specifically. <a href="info_on_crypto.html" target="_blank">Info on Crypto</a>
	Which has tons of useful info on Bitcoin and crypto anyways, so worth the read.
</p>
				
<p>	
	When you sign up to be an Affiliate with Ledger. They give you an account using a special code,
	that you login with.
	While you are in there you have access to a few images, banners and such, that you can use on your
	website or other places that you choose. Some of the banners have promotional offers so you can earn
	a possible 12% on some of the products, pretty sweet deal.
	You can add your affiliate code in there, and when people click on the link, that basically sticks a cookie
	with them. That has your information that allows you to earn, if they make a purchase within a certain time frame.
</p>
		
<p>
	Also with that Affiliate ID you can send that link out in your email offerings if you do any as a business owner,
	or other marketing procedures, again when they click on the link, and make a purchase you earn from that.

<p>As was saying above, there are two main wallets on the market to
	<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp" target="_blank">hodl</a>
	your crypto safe, Trezor is a excellent
	pick. The company itself is super responsive, and very informative. I’ve been very happy with the one I 
	purchased and will continue to buy their products in the future. You can feel very good about referring both
	of these companies! Here's a link to another of my blogs that talk about Hardware
	Wallets and these two brands specifically, it's called

<p>Robinhood App is a trading platform for Crypto, Stocks, and Option Trading. With a wide variety to choose
	from, it's a good one to have on the list. Robinhoods referral program offers you
	a stock off of their platform that’s chosen randomly. Will say honestly I don’t know every stock that is out
	on the market ha, but I did recognize just about everyone in their selection, and would be happy to have any 
	one of them.<a href="robinhood_app_review.html" target="_blank"> For more info on Robinhood you can

<p>
   Brave Browser is keeping the tradition alive of two thumbs up for recomendations here.
   They have an unstoppable
   product that is only going to gain more traction as times goes on, and people hear about it.
   If you dont know about Brave yet, and if this is the one piece of information you can gather
   from this website, is that Brave is a excellent free product that will better your internet experience.
   It blocks ads, trackers, device recognition. So many Awesome functions this browser has, that
   I wrote an entire blog about how Rad it actually is,
   called <a href="brave_review.html" target="_blank"> Brave Browser Review</a>. 
	Check it out here before you go to Brave if you'd like for a more in depth uderstanding
	of how the browser works, and what else it has to offer. Also under the title
	<a href="web_monetizing.html">Web Monetizing</a>
	is another blog that later on I wound up writing, then came back to update this section to add it, there's 
	great info on Brave as well in that, figured I would put a link in here for it. 
  </p>
		
   <p>
	Yes they have a few options for you to earn through Brave.
  </p>
	
		<p> 1. Is the Referral Program. Invite family, friends, kids, cats or dogs, and you can earn
		around $5 in 
		<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic-attention-token.asp" target="_blank">Basic Attention Token</a>, 
		also known as "BAT", if that person signs up and downloads the browser. Again "if", if that 
		indivdual keeps the browser downloaded for 30 days, then you get the $5. That is the basic 
		gist of it. They obviously have a longer agreement typed out ha, but for you to get an understanding,
		and see if it's something you'd be interest in, that's kinda what's going on.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Recently I seen they changed the rates, depending on where you're in the world, 
		actually they sent an email saying this.
		Guessing some areas have more value to them , so they're paying people extra if you are in the 
	    other desired locations.
		</p>

<br>
<br>
		
<p>
	As I see more programs will add them to the list here, so from time to time, come back and check out
	what else we've discovered, and felt was helpful or useful, and worth of sharing. Thank You, have fun,
	and much prosperity on your new money making adventures.
